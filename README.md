# DISES Project  
## This is where we store and manage our scripts to clean, analyze, and process data. No data is **ever** stored in these folders.

## Software used:  
Stata, R, and Python  

As of yet, there is no replication package associated with this.  

# Maintenance of scripts:  
All scripts must contain a README or comments explaining how to run the script. They should include:  
- What data is being processed.  
- What is being outputted (tables, figures, summaries, etc.).  
- File paths, which should be specified at the beginning of the script.  

# Order of Scripts:  
We organize our scripts in the following parts:  
* `Data_Cleaning/` – Prepares raw data for analysis (e.g., variable transformations, missing value handling).  
* `Data_Checks/` – Includes validation scripts to check data consistency and integrity.  
* `Data_Analysis/` – Contains scripts for statistical analysis, summarization, and result interpretation.  

## What to expect in each folder  

### Data_Analysis  
This folder contains scripts for data analysis, summarization, and manipulation with the intention of interpreting the results. Currently, the following scripts are stored here:  
* `Balance_Tables.do`  
* `Human_Parasitology.R`
